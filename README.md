# Jurney
Jurney is a MERN stack travel booking app with real-time weather updates, expert tour guides, and personalized schedules. I optimized the UI with React.js, integrated interactive maps, and implemented secure authentication. The backend handles requests efficiently with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
